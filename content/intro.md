# Introduction

Back in 2017, we were invited as guest editors for the journal "neuroimage", and organized a special issue on the topic of **brain parcellation and segmentation**. When all was said and done, there were 38 papers accepted for publication in that special issue, which provided a snapshot of a vibrant area of neuroimaging research. Parcellation, segmentation, clustering, community detection, etc., are different names for techniques aimed at dividing a collection of examples into subsets with similar statistical properties. Although clustering methods are used to solve seemingly disparate problems in neuroimaging, they all share the common goal of providing a broad understanding of the data, while abstracting away less relevant finer-grained information. So when the time came to write an editorial, we could not resist using a cluster analysis to organize these 38 papers into data-driven categories. You can find the editorial [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.063) (sadly behind a paywall). This jupyter book shows the short analysis that went into building the categories.

This analysis is possible thanks to the following projects:
 * The [python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.
 * [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org) is used to generate the html pages, and is itself based on [sphynx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org).
 * The [NeuroLibre](https://neurolibre.org) is hosting this jupyter book.
 * The [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) scientific library.
 * The [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) visualization library.
 * The [wordcloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) library.
